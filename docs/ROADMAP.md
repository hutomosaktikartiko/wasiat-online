- **SOL deposits & withdrawals** - Testers can deposit and withdraw SOL
- **SOL claim functionality** - Beneficiaries can claim SOL after being triggered
- **Service fee collection** - Percentage-based fees for sustainability
- **Emergency pause mechanism** - Admins can pause the system if needed
- **Admin Dashboard** - Edit configuration and view analytics

### Technical Implementation

- **Smart Contract**: Anchor program with basic will structure
- **Frontend**: Simple React dApp with wallet connection
- **Backend**: Go API server with SQLite
- **Keeper**: Basic cron job for monitoring

### Deliverables

- [🔄] **Anchor program deployed to devnet** - SOL-only instructions
- [✅] **Frontend dApp dengan basic UI** - Create, deposit, heartbeat, claim SOL
- [🔄] **Go backend dengan REST API** - Will monitoring & status tracking
- [✅] **Keeper service running** - Automated will triggering
- [✅] **Basic documentation** - User guides & API docs

### Success Metrics

- The program can be deployed without errors to the devnet.

### Smart Contract Evolution

```rust
// Phase 1: SOL-only structure
struct Will {
    testator: Pubkey,
    beneficiary: Pubkey,
    vault: Pubkey,              // Single SOL vault
    heartbeat_period: u32,
    status: WillStatus,
    // ... basic fields
}

// Phase 2: Multi-asset support
struct Will {
    testator: Pubkey,
    beneficiaries: Vec<Beneficiary>,
    sol_vault: Pubkey,          // Separate vaults per asset type
    token_vaults: Vec<TokenVault>,
    nft_vaults: Vec<NftVault>,
    // ... enhanced fields
}

// Phase 3: Enterprise features
struct Will {
    testator: Pubkey,
    beneficiaries: Vec<Beneficiary>,
    guardians: Vec<Guardian>,
    governance: GovernanceConfig,
    // ... enterprise fields
}
```
